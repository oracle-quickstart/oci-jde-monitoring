The report compares posted amounts in the A/R transaction tables to the amounts updated in the corresponding Account Balances table (F0902). The A/R transaction tables that are used by the UBE are: -Customer Ledger (F03B11) -Invoice Revisions (F03B112) -Receipts Header (F03B13) -Receipts Detail (F03B14) The program utilizes several Automatic Accounting Instructions (AAIs) to determine the open balances for the invoices sorting by the G/L Offset field. The program considers the A/R offset accounts (AAI item RC), write-off accounts (AAI item RA), deduction accounts (AAI item RN), discount accounts (AAI item RK), bank accounts (AAI item RB), delinquency fee accounts (AAI items RFC and RFD), and gain/loss accounts (AAI items RG and RL). The system stamps each A/R transaction with the appropriate account ID at the time that each record is created. When this integrity report is run, the program accumulates amounts from the A/R transaction tables by account ID, company, fiscal year, century, G/L period number, and base currency code. The system then prints the total open amount in the A/R tables and the balance in the Account Balance table. If there is a difference, it will print in the difference column of the report. The report will not consider R1 (draft invoices), RU (unapplied receipts), RB (chargeback invoices), and R5 (deduction) records from the Customer Ledger table (F03B11).

In the F43121 table the fields LNID is the Purchase Order Line Number and NLIN is the Receipt number. These should be in unique pairs for example Purchase Order Line LNID = 1 with Receipts NLIN = 1,2, and 3. The NLIN should never be duplicated for a given LNID (for example Purchase Order LNID = 2, with NLIN = 1, 2, 2, 3). 2) Confirm that the Receipt has not been Voucher Matched. The Receipt may display in Voucher Match but it should not be paid. 3) If the Receipt was for a Stock Item confirm that the Inventory is correct. Inventory may be corrected by a Cycle Count or manual adjustment if needed. 4) If needed create a manual Journal Entry to bring Received Not Vouchered Account to the correct balance. 5) Using a direct database update (SQL) set the F43121 Receipt Record to a Match Type = 5. This Match Type will make the record not display in applications while allowing it to remain in the table for history/audit purposes.

Answer 7: Possibly, 1. Go to databrowser and open up F41021WF and verify the audit information 2. Check e1root_*.log in JAS and jde_*.logs in EnterpriseOne to determine whether Commit Fail took place or not 3. If it does not have transaction failure message then try to simulate issue by running application with logging on 4. When log is traced user action, verify whether there is any missing bugs or similar Or, 1. Issue query as below, sql> select distinct (LWPIDP) from proddta.f41021wf; 2. Review User ID (F41021WF.LWUSER) 3. Inquire e1root_*.log whether it contains any commit fail error 4. If not, try to simulate the routine which leaves orphaned data from F41021WF 3. Are they the outcome of Commit Fail error or simply orphaned data 4. Check integrity between F4111 and F41021 (e.g., integrity check) 5. If needed, rollback it through P42210/R42210 or when there is no discrepancy between F4111 and F41021 truncate table F41021WF through query tool 6. In case you want to debug it further, capture both jasdebug.log and jdedebug.log to determine possible cause of orphaned data Next: Question 9: Can data from F41021WF are purged? Any concerns? Answer 9: Commonly as a month-end processing, you run R41544 (Item Balance\Ledger Integrity) [Refer to Document 625402.1 - E1: 41: As Of Processing (P4111 / P41112 / R41760 / R41540 / R41542)] and if there is no discrepancy between F41021 and F4111, you may purge data in F41021WF either through query tool or through Generate Table option in OMW (Object Management Workbench).

"JDEDIST_F4105_01","JDE Distribution sensor: Missing CSIN CSPO from F4105","2828503.1","The issue is caused due to data corruption in the F4105 table. The CSIN (Costing Selection - Inventory) is missing the value of ''I'' for one of the cost methods and the CSPO (Costing Selection - Purchasing) is missing the value of ''P'' in the same table. This usually happens with items that were imported into the F4105 table without those fields being set properly. To correct this issue, perform the following steps: 1. Using databrowser, verify the CSPO and CSIN do not have a value for any of the cost methods for the item in the F4105 (Item Cost) table. 2. Navigate to the P4101 (Item Master) and find the item. 3. Row Exit to Cost Revisions. 4. Select the item in the P4105. 5. Populate the Sales/Inventory and Purchasing Costing Method with the desired value. 6. Click OK to save the update to the F4105 table.
